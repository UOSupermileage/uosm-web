              <h3>Who are we?</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                UO Supermileage is a competitive student engineering team in the Faculty of Engineering at uOttawa. 
                As the university’s only electric car racing team, we develop an efficient, all-electric, 
                urban concept vehicle to compete in the Urban Electric category in the Shell Eco-Marathon. 
                The team is divided into mechanical, electrical, software, and business branches, allowing
                members to specialize and challenge themselves. We welcome passionate students from 
                all programs to join us
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>OUR GOAL</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Our focus is on the future—for the planet and for our members. We innovate efficient electrical 
                cars in pursuit of sustainability and a low impact on our environment. This team provides an 
                opportunity for electrical, mechanical, and software engineers to apply their knowledge via 
                hands-on work in an independent setting. Team members gain valuable experience for their 
                future by working in a cross-disciplinary setting. 
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>OUR COMPETITION - THE SHELL ECO-MARATHON</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                For our first year in 2018, we designed and built our car from the ground up, 
                tying electrical, mechanical, and software projects together. With all the systems 
                last year, we were able to pass technical inspection, get on the track, and gain 
                valuable experience. We were very proud of all we accomplished and have set 
                even higher goals.

                <br /><br />
                In 2019 with a larger team and strong support from our Faculty Advisers, 
                Dr. David Knox and Dr. Patrick Dumond, we ranked 4th in our category in 
                all of North America. This team would not be able to compete without the
                 support of CEED and the Faculty of Engineering at the University of 
                 Ottawa which provide us with the resources to work on the car.
